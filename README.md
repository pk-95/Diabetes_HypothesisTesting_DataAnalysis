# Diabetes_HypothesisTesting_DataAnalysis

## Maintainer: Pradish Kapur


## Problem Description
The objective is to analyse the provided data on Diabetes in females and find out the factors which largely cause the condition.

All patients in the dataset are female.

Diabetes is caused due to various factors such as pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI and age.
## Features in data set
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)2)

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)

Age: Age (years)
## Target Variable 
Outcome: Class variable (0 if non-diabetic, 1 if diabetic)
## Model Description
Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn libraries have been used for Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization.

Feature Scaling has been performed.
